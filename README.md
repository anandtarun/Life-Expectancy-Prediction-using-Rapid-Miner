# Life Expectancy Prediction using Rapid Miner

Used different algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees) to train and test, and evaluated the performance based on the following three metrics. And the Gradient Boosted Trees performed the best

root_mean_squared_error: 3.845 +/- 0.000
correlation: 0.969
squared_correlation: 0.939
